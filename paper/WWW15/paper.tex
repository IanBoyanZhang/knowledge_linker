Figures

Fig 1 -- Explanation of the metric: schematic diagram of paths and high-degree
vs low-degree nodes. Possibly extracted from the data. Take a look at diagram in
Leskovec paper on Wikipedia paths (WWW'12?).

Fig 2 -- Panel 1: local structure of politician-ideology network (with paths)
Panel 2: DWNOMINATE comparison plot. Table with F1, AUC for random forests and
nearest neighbors on all combos of metric/weight/{directed,undirected}

Fig 3 -- Four confusion matrices: oscars, capitals, presidents, countries

Fig 4 -- Relation extraction (only use DEGREE data): Panel 1: diagram with
snapshot from Wikipedia page text with sentence highlighted, mapped entities and
actual ratings. Panel 2: ROC curve plot (closure with edge removal, noclosure).

Quote rank order correlation (Kendall/Spearman) in text or as a table (panel 3
in Fig4 )
