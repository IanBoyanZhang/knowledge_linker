# Motivation /4

- Factually inaccurate statements are widespread and may be persistent across
  the public opinion.
- Causes: political partisanship, confirmation bias, resort to authority
  (e.g. experts, pundits).

- Fact checking is a painstaking activity
- Can we do it automatically?

# Approach 

- Inference on a large-scale semantic network
- __Intuitively__: how ``hard'' it is for an hypothetic agent to resolve a
  statement against a given body of knowledge?
- __Epistemic closure__: accept as new knowledge what is entailed (either
  empirically or logically) from current knowledge.
- Body of knowledge? Semantic networks!

# Clarification: ``epistemic closure'' $\ne$ epistemic closure

_One of the more striking features of the contemporary conservative
movement is the extent to which it has been moving toward __epistemic
closure__. Reality is defined by a multimedia array of interconnected and
cross promoting conservative blogs, radio programs, magazines, and of
course, Fox News. Whatever conflicts with that reality can be dismissed
out of hand because it comes from the liberal media, and is therefore
ipso facto not to be trusted._ [[source](http://www.juliansanchez.com/2010/03/26/frum-cocktail-parties-and-the-threat-of-doubt/)]

- Partisanship, Groupthink, filter bubble, etc.
- Former may be the result of the latter..

# Example /2 

## A path from Obama to Socialism (actual)

# Data cleaning

## Removed duplicate nodes

-   dbpedia:Person, foaf:Person, etc.

## Collapsed parallel edges

## Etc.

## Result:
-   3.14M nodes
-   23M edges


# Axiomatic approach

-   Let $G = \left(V, E\right)$, $t:V\times V \rightarrow \left[0,1\right]$
-   $t\left(v,w\right) = t\left(w,v\right)$
-   $\left(v,w\right)\in E \Rightarrow t\left(v,w\right) = 1$
-   If $d:V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb R$ is a distance measure:
-   $d\left(v,v^{'}\right) \ge d\left(v,v^{''}\right) \iff t\left(v,v^{'}\right) \le t\left(v,v^{''}\right)$

Measures

# Candidates for t

## Ultrametric (maxmin)

-   Detects “bottleneck” links

## Dijkstra

-   Isomorphic to (max, DT-1) in Proximity space
-   Path with lowest cost

## Diffusion

-   Isomorphic to harmonic mean in Distance space

# Current state

## Can our truth measure detect political partisanship?

-   Sources: all democrats/republicans born post 1940
-   Targets: all ideologies
-   Perform classification, compute F1
