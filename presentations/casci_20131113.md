# Motivation

-   Factually inaccurate statements are widespread and may be persistent across the public opinion
-   Fact checking is a painstaking activity
-   Can we do it automatically?

Resource Description Framework

# Data cleaning

## Removed duplicate nodes

-   dbpedia:Person, foaf:Person, etc.

## Collapsed parallel edges

## Etc.

## Result:
-   3.14M nodes
-   23M edges


# Axiomatic approach

-   Let $G = \left(V, E\right)$, $t:V\times V \rightarrow \left[0,1\right]$
-   $t\left(v,w\right) = t\left(w,v\right)$
-   $\left(v,w\right)\in E \Rightarrow t\left(v,w\right) = 1$
-   If $d:V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb R$ is a distance measure:
-   $d\left(v,v^{'}\right) \ge d\left(v,v^{''}\right) \iff t\left(v,v^{'}\right) \le t\left(v,v^{''}\right)$

Measures

# Candidates for t

## Ultrametric (maxmin)

-   Detects “bottleneck” links

## Dijkstra

-   Isomorphic to (max, DT-1) in Proximity space
-   Path with lowest cost

## Diffusion

-   Isomorphic to harmonic mean in Distance space

# Current state

## Can our truth measure detect political partisanship?

-   Sources: all democrats/republicans born post 1940
-   Targets: all ideologies
-   Perform classification, compute F1
